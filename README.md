# Art by @fascinatedberry on GitHub, THANK YOU!! ^^

üêö . BYI: I'm a Shellvision shipper, but I'm not like those stereotypes who randomly go around and kiss Vee ponies. I don't force anyone to ship it, and I'll respect you if you don't like it, but please don't shove the fact that you hate it in my face.
--------------------
‚ö° . Read strawpage for info, pronouns.cc for extra (IRLs, fictkins, copinglinks etc)! C+H is always welcomed unless there's ''DNI...'' in my name. I will follow your GitHub back if I find you cool!

# Quick info about Ships

-Veestro __(Vee X Astro)__ please do __not__ interact. (unless friend or respectful)

-Moonshell __(Astro X Shelly)__ and Berryvision __(Sprout X Vee)__ is __on thin ice__. (unless friend or respectful)

# I know I look selfish, but I can't force myself to like the ships. Especially Veestro. Of course I'll respect you, but I just can't change my opinion on them no matter how hard I try.
